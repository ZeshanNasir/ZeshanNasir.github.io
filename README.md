# Welcome to ZeshanNasir.github.io! üëã

Hello and welcome to my GitHub Pages site! This is a space where I share my projects, ideas, and journey in the world of development.

## For Beginners üå±

If you're new to GitHub or web development, this repository is a great example of how GitHub Pages works:

- **GitHub Pages** is a free hosting service that turns your GitHub repository into a website
- This repository (ZeshanNasir.github.io) automatically becomes a website at https://zeshannasir.github.io
- You can create your own by making a repository named `yourusername.github.io`

2. **Open locally**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or use a local server:
